# Task Management System

This project is powered by Laravel.

## Feaures

**1. Task Prioritization:** Implement a mechanism for users to prioritize tasks based on their importance or urgency. This could involve assigning numerical values or using a color-coded system to distinguish between high, medium, and low priorities.

**2. Task Assignment and Collaboration:** Enable task assignment to multiple users, allowing for team collaboration and shared responsibility. This could involve creating a task hierarchy with parent and child tasks to represent subtasks and assign them to different users.

**3. Task Completion Status Tracking:** Provide a clear indication of task completion status, with options like "Pending," "In Progress," "Completed," and "Deferred." This could involve adding progress bars or statuses next to each task.

**4. Task Dependencies and Workflow Management:** Allow users to define dependencies between tasks, indicating which tasks must be completed before others can start. This could involve creating a task dependency graph to visualize the workflow.

**5. Task Filtering and Searching:** Implement filtering and searching capabilities to help users find specific tasks based on various criteria, such as title, description, category, priority, assignee, and status.

**6. Task Attachments and Notes:** Provide the ability to attach files or documents to tasks and add notes for further details or clarification. This could involve a file upload feature and a dedicated notes section for each task.

**7. Task Time Tracking:** Integrate time tracking functionality to record the time spent on each task. This could involve a timer feature, allowing users to start and stop tracking time for specific tasks.

**8. Task Reminders and Notifications:** Set up reminders for upcoming deadlines and task completions. This could involve sending email or push notifications to users.

**9. Task Reports and Analytics:** Generate reports and analytics to provide insights into task completion rates, user productivity, and task status distribution. This could involve data visualizations and charts.
